(e)Suppose a list contains positive and negative numbers. Write a program to create two lists-one containing positive numbers and another containing negative numbers.

Program:
n= [-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4]
positive_n= [x for x in n if x > 0]
negative_n= [x for x in n if x < 0]
print("Positive numbers are",positive_n)
print("Negative numbers are",negative_n)

Output:
Positive numbers are [1, 2, 3, 4]
Negative numbers are [-4, -3, -2, -1]
