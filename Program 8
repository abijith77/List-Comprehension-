(h) Write a program to generate a 2D matrix of size 4 x 5 containing random multiples of 4 in the range 40 to 160

Program:
import random
multiples_4 = [x for x in range(40, 161) if x % 4 == 0]
matrix = [[random.choice(multiples_4) for _ in range(5)] for _ in range(4)]
print("The 2D matrices of 4x5 is displayed below")
for row in matrix:
    print(row)

Output:
The 2D matrices of 4x5 is displayed below
[72, 148, 96, 144, 160]
[52, 88, 64, 120, 56]
[96, 56, 152, 64, 44]
[160, 92, 116, 52, 136]
