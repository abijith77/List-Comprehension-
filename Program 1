(a)Write a program that generates a list of integer coordinates for all points in the first quadrant from (1, 1) to (5, 5). Use list comprehension.

Program:
int= [(x, y) for x in range(1, 6) for y in range(1, 6)]
print(int)

Output:
[(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)]
